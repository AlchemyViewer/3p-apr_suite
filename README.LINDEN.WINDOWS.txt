In order to facilitate building on Windows, the APR project is distributed with a set of Visual Studio 6 .dsw and .dsp files. 
Since we use a newer build toolchain, they must first be imported and converted to the new file format (e.g. .sln and .vcxproj 
for VS2010). If this autobuild package fails to build on Windows after upgrading to a new version, it may be necessary to 
reimport the newer VS6 files to pick up changes in the files that make up APR.

After importing the Visual Studio 6 .dsw files into VS2010, the link information for each of the projects was missing. The 
build for libapriconv and libaprutil failed during the link step because they depend on libapr and other libs. In this commit, 
I have fixed the problem in the respective vcxproj files, however, if this library is upgraded again and the VS6 dsw file is 
imported again, it is likely that the information will be lost on import again. The process I followed to set up the link 
information is below:

1. Open the aprutil.sln solution that was created by importing the aprutil.dsw file.

2. Right click the project you need to fix (libapriconv or libaprutil) and choose properties.

3. Expand VC++ Directories and edit the Library Directories line. At the end, append a path to the directory containing the
	.lib file you would like to link. Relative paths work.

4. Expand the linker tab in the sidebar and select input. Prepend the name of the .lib file you are linking.

The process above needs to be repeated for both the debug and release targets of each library that is fixed. I chose to link 
the expat lib file from the 3p-expat autobuild package instead of the one generated by the xml project included in the apr 
source distribution.
